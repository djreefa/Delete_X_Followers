# Delete_X_Followers
REMOVE ALL FOLLOWERS ON X

So what you will do is find the DeleteXFollowers.js file, copy the entire contents into your clipboard, then in a new tab or whatever, just open twitter, go to your followers tab, then open the developer console by pressing F12 on the keyboard then click the CONSOLE tab.  You will then paste the code into there. Just copy all of it and paste it. If you copy the comment (instruction within the file) that is okay nothing will happen it is commented out by the double frontslash.
